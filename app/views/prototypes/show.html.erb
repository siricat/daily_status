    <h3>Status Detail</h3>
    <p>I have completed the designs for Trackinator in Photoshop. I am moving
      on to implementing the designs into the application on certain pages that
      have been set up by Michael Moen. Once the designs are implemented, I will
      move on to setting up individual pages. See wireframe attached.
